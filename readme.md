### MODULE AND PIP IN PYTHON
Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

Now we can use the module we just created, by using the import statement:
```py
import mymodule
mymodule.greeting("Jonathan")
```

we can install module by pip package like <-npm package->
